# Current Feature: CHUVI V1 AI Assistant — in-app bot upgrade (Phases A–D)

**STATUS 2026-08-24: MERGED TO `main`.** All bot V1/V1.1 work (Phases A–D + V1.1 parts + the 3
staging-run bug fixes: payment-step pin, OTP-step pin, styler gating) is committed and merged to
main — no longer uncommitted. The staging gate passed 11/11 (see session.md). **Next gate is NOT
backend:** the frontend team builds the two FE tasks (quickActions chips + complaint photo upload),
then INTEGRATION-TEST the live bot with REAL production data end-to-end from the app. Historical
"UNCOMMITTED" notes below predate the merge — read them as "what was built," not current git state.
Started from a client doc ("CHUVI V1 AI Assistant") that turns the read-only Phase-6 bot
into a full conversational assistant that answers AND takes actions. Approved plan file:
`C:\Users\LENOVO\.claude\plans\take-a-look-at-majestic-cherny.md`. Blow-by-blow in session.md.

## The two-bot distinction (client-confirmed — never blur this)
- **In-app bot = THIS repo.** `botIntent` + `botOrchestrator` + `Conversation`/`ChatMessage`
  support thread + sockets. Everything below is the in-app bot.
- **WhatsApp bot = SEPARATE repo.** It consumes THIS backend via the EXISTING REST APIs
  (order status, place order, open case, …) and owns its own conversation over there.
  There is NO special WhatsApp bridge endpoint here (an earlier `/bot/internal/crm-reply`
  was built then REMOVED — no consumer). Do NOT re-add one; do NOT build a stateless "brain"
  endpoint unless the client explicitly asks (would need the orchestrator decoupled from the
  in-app Conversation).

## Locked client decisions
1. The bot NOW quotes prices, places orders, opens complaints, records feedback, applies
   wallet payment, changes phone (OTP) — **each behind an explicit confirm + audit**.
2. Hard guardrails STAY (structural — never invent data; the bot has NO code path to):
   approve refunds/compensation, edit wallet balances/credits, release referral rewards,
   or resolve/close complaint cases. Those + anything unhandled → human handoff.
3. Phased build **A→D**, each shippable on its own.

## Core architecture (how the whole thing hangs together)
- LLM does TWO jobs only (`services/botIntent.service.js`): `classify()` → one `BOT_INTENT`
  (+ `intents[]` for compound, + rich `slots`), and `smallTalkReply()` for greetings/OOS.
  Keyword `rulesFallback` when no provider key / LLM fails (never hard-fails).
- `services/botOrchestrator.service.js` is the deterministic brain: routes intent → workflow.
  Multi-turn flows persist on `conversation.botState = { intent, step, slots, memory }`.
- **Reuse pattern that unblocked everything:** the controller-style services (`postBookOrder`,
  `payWithWallet`, `submitFeedback`) never touch `res` and return the plain `{success,data}`
  envelope — so the bot drives them with a synthetic `{ body, user:{id} }` request and reuses
  the EXACT production pricing/validation/credit/audit path. No money logic duplicated.
- Every write action is behind a confirm step; wallet/case/OTP verified before mutating.

## Deliverables checklist — Phases A–D ALL DONE (stub-verified; reads live-verified)

### Phase A — understanding core + conversation memory  ✅
- [x] `conversation.model.js`: added `botState.memory` (Mixed) — survives the per-turn reset.
- [x] NEW `services/botContext.service.js`: `getLastOrder`/`buildOrderSnapshot`,
      `detectReferent` (the usual / same-as-last / same place / go ahead / pronoun),
      `savedDefaults`, `loadMemory`/`mergeMemory`.
- [x] `botIntent`: expanded `slots` (items[], pickupDate, pickupTime, addressRef same/home/office,
      address, itemName, amount) + prompt extracts stated details only, never resolves refs.
- [x] `botOrchestrator`: PRESERVES `memory` across the botState reset (`_runSingle` + batch,
      `markModified`); `_updateMemory` (lastIntent + lastOrder snapshot on order-touching turns);
      `_resolveAddressRef` turns addressRef:"same" → real address from memory/profile.

### Phase B — read-only answers  ✅
- [x] New intents: pricing, turnaround, service-info, policy, payment-status, reward-status.
- [x] `pricingReply` (per-piece = `roundToNearestHundred(OrderItem.price × serviceType.pricePerPiece)`
      — the EXACT booking math; item or general list), `turnaroundReply`, `serviceInfoReply`,
      `policyReply` (curated approved facts only; null→handoff), `paymentStatusReply` (reads
      BookOrder.paymentStatus; never accuses), `rewardStatusReply` (referral ledger; never releases).
- [x] Enriched `orderStatusReply`: `STAGE_EXPLAIN` plain-language stage +
      `_readinessAndDispatchLine` ("are they ready?"/"has the rider left?") from stage+dispatchDetails.
- [x] Batching (READ_ONLY_INFO + icons), classifier prompt + rules keywords, swagger enum.

### Phase C — confirmed + audited actions  ✅
- [x] **Booking** (`bookingFlow`): BOOKING_GUIDE runs slot-fill (items→service→address→date/time→
      confirm) → `BookOrderService.createOrder({userId,payload})` (thin wrapper over postBookOrder).
      "the usual" prefills from `memory.lastOrder`. Helpers: `_placeBooking`, `_resolveBookingItems`,
      `_parseItemsFromText`, `_matchServiceType`, `_bookingEstimate`, `_resolvePickupDate`.
- [x] **Apply-payment** (`applyPaymentFlow`, intent APPLY_PAYMENT): latest unpaid order → confirm →
      `WalletService.payWithWallet(useCredit:true)` + audit. Insufficient→handoff.
- [x] **Complaint** (`complaintFlow`, FILE_COMPLAINT no longer just hands off): order → DEDUPE vs open
      ComplaintCase → match/pick ComplaintType (`_matchComplaintType`/`_pickComplaintType`) → optional
      photo (attachments threaded handleCustomerMessage→_runSingle→runWorkflow) → confirm →
      `RecoveryService.openCase`. Opens+routes to CX, never resolves.
- [x] **Feedback** (`feedbackFlow`): delivered order → 1–5 (`_parseRating`) → `FeedbackService.submitFeedback`
      (≥4 satisfied/3 neutral); ≤2 offers to open a complaint (routes into complaintFlow).
- [x] **Phone OTP** (`_startPhoneOtp` + `verify-phone-otp` step in updateDetails): sendSmsOtp(new number),
      write only on matching code; pending number under `pendingPhone` (classifier can't clobber);
      5-min expiry; SMS-send fail→handoff; address change stays no-OTP.

### Phase D — quick actions + in-app CRM framing  ✅
- [x] `quickActions[]` (`{label,message}`) on every turn via `_quickActionsForTurn` (confirm→Yes/No,
      mid-collect→Talk To Staff, answered→MAIN menu, handoff→none). Surfaced by `botApi._replyPayload`
      (sendMessage + replyToConversation bot branch). Tapping sends `message` as the next message.
- [x] `crmContext` framing: `handleCustomerMessage` optional param → block B2 frames an AMBIGUOUS reply
      (`_crmFrameToIntent`: reactivation→booking/human, reorder→booking, feedback/post-delivery→feedback,
      lead→booking); passed via the normal `POST /bot/message` body (in-app deep-link from a CRM nudge).
- [x] Booking-routing fix: classifier prompt never told the LLM to use booking-guide → added prompt line
      + offline rules branch (book my/carry my/come carry/the usual…) BEFORE order-status.

## Files touched (all uncommitted)
- `services/botOrchestrator.service.js` (biggest — all workflows + helpers + memory + quick actions + CRM frame)
- `services/botIntent.service.js` (slot schema, prompt, rules), NEW `services/botContext.service.js`
- `services/bookOrder.service.js` (createOrder wrapper), `services/botApi.service.js` (_replyPayload + crmContext)
- `models/conversation.model.js` (botState.memory)
- `util/constants.js` (new BOT_INTENTs), `util/page-route.js` (net no change — crm-reply added then removed)
- `controllers/bot.controller.js` (net no change), `routes/bot.js` (message desc + crmContext + BotReply doc)
- `swagger/schemas.js` (BotReply intent enum + quickActions), `CLAUDE.md`, `context/session.md`

## Verified
- Unit/stub: each workflow simulated (staged botState) — booking 6-turn + the-usual + cancel; apply-payment
  routing/confirm/insufficient; complaint auto-match/pick/dedupe/no-order; feedback pos/neutral/poor;
  phone-OTP send/wrong/right/expired; quickActions per turn; CRM frame 7 cases; offline routing 10/10.
- LIVE (real DB + real LLM): boot :7333 → /api-docs 200, /bot/message 401; read-path smoke (greeting,
  pricing ₦700, turnaround, service-info, order-status, wallet, offers) all correct + chips; cleaned up.
- Swagger: 41 schemas parse; quickActions + crmContext + intents + description all present.

## What later phases / commit expect (STILL TO DO)
- **WRITE actions STAGING GATE — PASSED 2026-08-24 (11/11 green).** Ran `botStaging.js` against a real
  Atlas DB (throwaway user, real LLM + Paystack + Termii). All write paths verified end-to-end:
  booking→wallet (success, pay-from-wallet, credit opt-in), booking→card (real Paystack link, stays
  PENDING), apply-payment (credit+cash, success), complaint (case opened→CX), feedback (5/5), phone-OTP
  (SMS + verify + write). Cleanup removed all records. **The run FOUND & FIXED 3 real product bugs**
  (uncommitted, in `botOrchestrator.service.js`): (1) payment-step intent hijack — typed "by card"
  hijacked the booking payment → pinned `collect-payment`; (2) OTP-step hijack — 6-digit code read as an
  order number → pinned `verify-phone-otp`; (3) reply styler mangling flow prompts + leaking a `§`
  placeholder → styler now only warms terminal replies + `§`/`?`-flip guards. Details in session.md.
  - Harness: `STAGING_OK=1 node botStaging.js --seed` (no staging DB → point MONGODB_URL at a throwaway
    local/Atlas Mongo; `--seed` seeds catalog+settings). Flags `--only=`, `--credit`, `--keep`; env
    `TERMII_API_KEY`/`STAGING_PHONE` for OTP. Safety-gated (refuses prod without `STAGING_FORCE=1`).
- Frontend work (only two real tasks): render `quickActions` chips (tap → send `message`); wire photo
  upload (`POST /api/utils/image-upload-single`) → `attachments[]` for complaints. Copy-paste FE handoff
  block is in the session (changelog + tasks).
- Then commit (client review gate — confirm first).

## NEXT WORK PACKAGE — Bot Intelligence & Fixes (V1.1) — PLANNED, NOT STARTED

Approved direction (2026-08-21, client via user): make the bot **smarter + less verbose without
scope drift**, and fix two real defects. Design principle stays: **LLM understands & phrases;
deterministic code owns every fact & action; guardrails from "Locked client decisions" unchanged.**
The LLM never generates a data answer — only (1) classify, (2) extract slots, (3) [NEW] tighten/warm
a fixed reply, (4) small-talk.

**Motivating evidence (client screenshot, WhatsApp/in-app booking):** bot repeated
*"When should we come? …"* 3× while the customer answered ("Tomorrow same address as before" + tried
to change items). Root cause in `bookingFlow`:
- `botOrchestrator.service.js:771` — on `collect-datetime` it dumps the WHOLE message into the date
  field ("Tomorrow same address as before" becomes the "date").
- `:772` — time ONLY comes from the LLM `pickupTime` slot; customer gave none → stays empty.
- `:842` — step requires BOTH date AND time → re-asks the IDENTICAL line forever (no attempt counter,
  no rephrase, no escape).

### Parts (priority order) — ALL PARTS DONE 2026-08-22/23 (stub-verified, UNCOMMITTED); live staging pending
1. **G — PAYMENT GATE (highest; a money bug). ✅ DONE.** Booking now places the order then routes to a
   `collect-payment` step (`_bookingPaymentStep`): wallet (`payWithWallet` + audit) or card (Paystack
   `initializePayment` → `authorization_url` link; order PENDING until webhook). `_placeBooking` no
   longer says "Done" for an unpaid order (≤0 → "fully covered"). Helpers `_parsePaymentChoice`,
   `_walletAvailable`; chips [Pay from wallet][Pay by card]. STILL TO DO: live staging (real money).
   **Billing follow-up DONE 2026-08-22:** (a) subscription-aware — `_placeBooking` tries `pay-from-subscription`
   first for active subscribers (reuses postBookOrder validation; rejected attempt creates no order), success →
   "covered by your plan" (no payment step), rejection → pay-per-item fallback + reason (`_subFallbackLead`);
   (b) wallet billingType label match — stamp order `billingType='pay-from-wallet'` after successful wallet
   settlement (card stays pay-per-item); (c) `_walletAvailable` hardened to the canonical
   `WalletCreditService.getCreditBalances`. Credits (all types, credit-first) confirmed covered by the shared
   `chargeWalletForOrder`. **Credit opt-in DONE 2026-08-23:** the bot now ASKS before spending reward credit
   (only when creditTotal>0) in BOTH wallet paths — `confirm-credit` (booking) / `confirm-pay-credit`
   (apply-payment); yes→credit-first, no→cash-only (else reroute). Shared `_settleWalletCharge` (charge+audit
   +billingType stamp) used by both. No longer always credit-first.
   Original problem statement: `_placeBooking` creates a `pay-per-item` order UNPAID
   and says *"Done! …you can pay in the app"* (`botOrchestrator.service.js:882,907`) — no payment
   collected, billing method hardcoded, booking declared complete with ₦0 taken. Fix: after the
   customer confirms, CONTINUE into a payment step — ask wallet vs card (offer subscription if an
   active plan). Wallet → reuse `WalletService.payWithWallet` (insufficient → top-up/card). Card →
   `initialize-payment` (`transactionType:'order'`) → send `authorization_url` as a "Pay now" chip;
   order stays PENDING until the existing Paystack webhook confirms (bot never confirms payment
   itself). Wording: "placed — awaiting payment", NOT "Done ✅", until paid. Track pending so the
   loop/handoff logic can nudge unpaid orders. Guardrail: bot gains NO new money authority (own
   wallet on own order, or a standard Paystack link the customer authorizes).
2. **C — LOOP/REPEAT GUARD (bug; stops the 3× repeat). ✅ DONE.** `_applyLoopGuard` in `_runSingle`:
   counts stalls (same step+intent = no advance) in `botState.slots._stall`; 1st → "(tap Talk To Staff)"
   hint, 2nd → stop repeating + offer human via existing `offered-handoff`. Resets on advance. General
   (all flows). NOTE: C only stops the infinite LOOP — the datetime PARSE fix that makes booking actually
   understand "tomorrow same address" is A+B (still pending).
3. **A + B — IN-FLOW UNDERSTANDING + SMART DEFAULTS. ✅ DONE 2026-08-23.** Removed the "whole message =
   date" dump; date/time now come from LLM slots → `_parseDateTimeFromText` fallback (parsed every turn,
   so "tomorrow morning" fills both). DATE-ONLY accepted → `_defaultPickupWindow` defaults the time
   (`bTimeAuto` flag, shown as "default window" at confirm). `_parseItemsFromText` reads spelled-out
   numbers; `_resolvePickupDate` handles "day after tomorrow". Verified end-to-end that the screenshot
   scenario ("Tomorrow same address as before" at collect-datetime) now ADVANCES instead of looping.
   (This is the deterministic/offline layer; the LLM already supplies the slots when up — A makes the
   flow USE them + adds a safe fallback.)
   **Booking extras DONE 2026-08-23 (on request):** (i) offline number words incl. tens/compounds
   (`_wordToNumber`, "fifty shorts"); (ii) large-quantity confirm (`confirm-qty`, >30) guarding typos;
   (iii) **delivery-speed selection** (`collect-speed`) — offers only speeds available at the current
   clock via `calculateDueDate` (same-day<10am/express<2pm/standard), charge+ETA in estimate & summary,
   and reroutes to another speed if the cut-off passes / capacity fills at placement (was hardcoded
   standard). NOTE: plan/capacity limits still count LINE ITEMS not quantity (pre-existing, not changed).
4. **D — MID-FLOW CORRECTIONS & SIDE-QUESTIONS. ✅ DONE 2026-08-23.** Mid-flow **cancel** (`_isCancel`,
   clears flow keeps memory) + **side-question** (D2 block: pricing/turnaround/service-info conf≥0.6 during
   a collect step → answer via runWorkflow then resume via runWorkflow(text:'') , stall reset). Corrections
   ("actually 2 shirts") already covered by A's per-turn slot re-ingest. (No new LLM output field needed —
   derived from existing classify intent/confidence + keywords.)
5. **E — REPLY STYLER. ✅ DONE 2026-08-23.** `botIntent.styleReply` + `_maybeStyle`: tokenize all data
   (₦/OSC/times/numbers/%) → LLM ≤2 warm sentences → require every token back or FALL BACK to exact text;
   skips multi-line/link/<25-char replies (summaries/offers/links intact); applied per reply in `_runSingle`;
   gated `BOT_STYLE_REPLIES` (default on, "false" disables), no-op without provider. Chips-first already
   shipped (Phase D). Cost: +1 LLM call per prose reply — flagged.
6. **F — GUARDRAILS STAY (standing rule, not a task).** LLM never quotes an unapproved price, invents
   order/wallet data, acts without the existing confirm+audit, approves refunds/compensation, or
   resolves a case. "Smarter" only ever = better understanding + tone.

**Do first before the bot touches a live customer: G + C (they're bugs, not enhancements).**

## Housekeeping for a fresh session
- Read summary.md + session.md + this file first (CLAUDE.md rule).
- Bot section of CLAUDE.md was rewritten to the new "acts-with-confirm" direction incl. Phase A–D status —
  trust it over any older "the bot never places an order / never quotes prices" phrasing elsewhere.
- Provider: no key in a bare `node -e` (rules path); the full app chain loads dotenv so classify() hits the
  LLM — mind token cost when smoke-testing via the app.
